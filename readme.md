# Database Development Assignment

## Requirements
Python 3.11
MySQL 8.0

## Getting Started
Open this root folder with VSCode

Then either 

*  Create a New environment from within VSCode (you may be prompted to do this)
    * Make sure you create the environment using the `requirements.txt` file provided

OR:

* Use **pip** (or pip3 on OSX) to install Python packages
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running App

### Python
You should be able to open `app.py` and run it directly from VSCode

### MySQL

A Docker Compose file is given to start an image in docker, however creating the MySQL database manually will work too. 

There are provided scripts to create and add data to the database, this can be done though MySQL workbench if the docker compose file is not used.
